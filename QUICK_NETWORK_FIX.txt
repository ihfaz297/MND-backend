QUICK FIX: Phone Can't Reach Backend (Router Isolation Issue)
================================================================================

PROBLEM IDENTIFIED:
Your phone cannot ping your PC (192.168.31.119) because your router is blocking
WiFi-to-LAN communication. This is NOT a backend or firewall issue!

================================================================================
SOLUTION 1: Connect PC to WiFi (FASTEST - 2 minutes)
================================================================================

1. UNPLUG the Ethernet cable from your PC

2. CONNECT your PC to WiFi:
   - Click WiFi icon in taskbar
   - Select the same WiFi network your phone is on
   - Enter password and connect

3. GET YOUR NEW IP ADDRESS:
   Open PowerShell and run:
   
   ipconfig | Select-String "IPv4"
   
   Look for the WiFi adapter IP (probably still 192.168.31.xxx)

4. RESTART the backend server:
   - Press Ctrl+C in the terminal to stop
   - Run: npm run dev
   - The server will show your new WiFi IP address

5. TEST from your phone's browser:
   http://NEW_IP_ADDRESS:3000/api/health
   
   (Use the IP shown when server starts)

This should work immediately!

================================================================================
SOLUTION 2: Disable Router AP Isolation (PERMANENT FIX)
================================================================================

If you want to keep using LAN and still allow phone access:

1. OPEN ROUTER ADMIN PANEL:
   - Browser: http://192.168.31.1
   - Login (check router sticker for password, often "admin/admin")

2. FIND WIRELESS SETTINGS:
   Look for sections named:
   - Wireless Settings
   - Advanced Settings
   - Security Settings

3. DISABLE THESE OPTIONS (if you find them):
   - AP Isolation
   - Client Isolation
   - Wireless Isolation
   - Inter-Station Traffic (enable this if found)
   - SSID Isolation
   - "Prevent client-to-client communication"

4. SAVE and REBOOT router

5. TEST ping from phone again

Router models with this issue:
- TP-Link: Wireless → Wireless Security → AP Isolation (disable)
- Xiaomi/Mi: Advanced → AP Isolation (disable)
- Linksys: Wireless → Advanced → AP Isolation (disable)
- Netgear: Advanced → Wireless Settings → Enable Wireless Isolation (uncheck)

================================================================================
SOLUTION 3: Use Phone Hotspot (FOR TESTING)
================================================================================

If you just want to test if your React app works:

1. ENABLE HOTSPOT on your phone
2. CONNECT your PC to your phone's hotspot
3. RESTART backend server (will get new IP from phone's network)
4. ACCESS from phone's browser using the new IP

This proves everything works and bypasses your router completely.

================================================================================
WHAT'S HAPPENING TECHNICALLY
================================================================================

Your router has TWO separate networks:
- LAN (Ethernet): 192.168.31.x
- WiFi: 192.168.31.x (same range but isolated)

Even though they're on the same IP range, the router is blocking traffic
between them for security reasons.

Test confirms:
✅ PC can access server locally (localhost)
✅ PC can access server via network IP (192.168.31.119)
✅ Server is listening on all interfaces (0.0.0.0:3000)
✅ Firewall rule exists for port 3000
❌ Phone cannot ping PC at all <- THIS IS THE ROOT CAUSE

The backend code is 100% correct. This is purely a router configuration issue.

================================================================================
RECOMMENDED ACTION
================================================================================

For immediate testing and development:
→ Use SOLUTION 1 (Connect PC to WiFi)

For permanent setup:
→ Use SOLUTION 2 (Disable router AP isolation)

The backend is ready. Once you fix the network isolation, your phone, React
app, and future Kotlin app will all be able to connect!
